# EZ Flash Cards
## About
<strong>EZ Flash Card</strong> is a mobile application build with React Native.
The reason I came up creating this was due to my need for a flash card app for me to study for an upcomming certification I was aiming for. I had a bunch of books and some practice questions but I find it burdensome to carry them around all of the time. Instead, I'd like to do these practice tests anywhere and anytime I want to.

Another reason is to be able to add something to my portfolio. I am a freelance developer and most of my work goes through strcit NDA's. Making it hard for me to prove my experience on some Technologies when I am asked of the works I had done. I hope I could use this app a such source to be viewed if needed.
